                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold border-b border-slate-300 pb-1 mt-6 mb-4">1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This policy establishes a standardized, evidence-based framework for the pre-procedure assessment and readiness verification of all patients undergoing anesthesia, regional anesthesia, monitored anesthesia care (MAC), or procedural sedation. This comprehensive protocol applies uniformly across all Operating Room (OR) and Non-Operating Room Anesthesia (NORA) environments within the healthcare organization.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Objectives:</strong> The primary objective is to eliminate preventable peri-procedural harm through rigorous risk identification, physiological optimization, and systematic verification of patient readiness. This policy mandates structured clinical assessments to identify comorbidities, airway difficulties, aspiration risks, and medication interactions prior to the induction of anesthesia or sedation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scope Statement:</strong> The mandate extends to all licensed independent practitioners, nurses, and technicians involved in the delivery or monitoring of anesthesia and procedural sedation. It encompasses elective, urgent, and emergency procedures performed in surgical suites, endoscopy units, interventional radiology labs, cardiac catheterization labs, and ambulatory surgery centers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong> Implementation of this policy is expected to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce the incidence of adverse anesthesia events, including aspiration, airway mismanagement, and medication errors.</li>
                        <li>Standardize the definition of patient readiness to minimize day-of-surgery cancellations and delays.</li>
                        <li>Ensure full compliance with national and international accreditation standards (e.g., CBAHI, JCI) regarding perioperative safety.</li>
                        <li>Enhance interdisciplinary communication through mandatory checklists and standardized documentation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">2.1 Detailed Purpose</h3>
                    <p>To ensure that every patient receiving anesthesia care or procedural sedation undergoes a rigorous, standardized pre-procedure evaluation. This process is designed to support safe anesthetic planning, facilitate risk reduction strategies, ensure valid informed consent, and verify correct patient/procedure/site identification across all clinical settings.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">2.2 Clinical Rationale</h3>
                    <p>Pre-anesthesia assessment is the cornerstone of perioperative safety. Scientific literature consistently demonstrates that inadequate pre-operative evaluation is a contributing factor in a significant proportion of anesthesia-related mortality and morbidity. A structured assessment allows for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Risk Stratification:</strong> Identification of patients with low physiological reserve who require enhanced monitoring or postoperative intensive care.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Opportunity to manage reversible conditions (e.g., hypertension, anemia, hyperglycemia) to improve outcomes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Airway Management Planning:</strong> Detection of anatomical predictors for difficult airway management, allowing for the mobilization of advanced airway equipment and personnel.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pharmacological Management:</strong> Prevention of adverse drug interactions and management of critical medications such as anticoagulants and insulin.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">2.3 Patient Safety Imperatives</h3>
                    <p>This policy operationalizes the "Universal Protocol" for preventing wrong-site, wrong-procedure, and wrong-person surgery. Furthermore, it addresses critical safety domains including pulmonary aspiration prevention (NPO guidelines), allergy verification, and infection control integration.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">2.4 Regulatory Compliance</h3>
                    <p>This document aligns organizational practice with the standards set forth by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CBAHI (Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions):</strong> Specifically standards regarding Perioperative Safety (POR).</li>
                        <li><strong>ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists):</strong> Basic Standards for Preanesthesia Care and Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting.</li>

                    <p>The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine mandates strict adherence to the following core principles. Failure to comply constitutes a breach of patient safety standards.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Mandatory Assessment:</strong> A documented pre-anesthesia or pre-sedation assessment shall be completed for 100% of applicable patients prior to the induction of anesthesia or administration of sedation.</li>
                        <li><strong>ASA Classification:</strong> An ASA-PS classification score must be assigned and documented for every patient.</li>
                        <li><strong>Airway Evaluation:</strong> A focused airway assessment and risk stratification (Easy/Difficult/Uncertain) must be documented, with a specific management plan for any anticipated difficulty.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fasting Verification:</strong> Compliance with NPO guidelines must be verified. For urgent/emergency cases where fasting is compromised, a risk mitigation plan (e.g., Rapid Sequence Induction) must be documented.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medication Safety:</strong> Medication reconciliation and allergy verification are prerequisites for transfer to the procedural area.</li>
                        <li><strong>Testing Stewardship:</strong> Pre-operative testing should be driven by clinical indication and patient history, not by routine protocols.</li>
                        <li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Separate informed consent for anesthesia/sedation is required, distinct from the surgical consent, discussing specific anesthetic risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standardized Readiness:</strong> Patient acceptance into the OR/Procedure room is contingent upon the completion of a "Sign-In" safety check verifying identity, site, and consent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ambulatory Safety:</strong> Day-surgery candidates must meet specific physiological and social criteria to ensure safe discharge.</li>

                        <li><strong>Elective Low-Risk Cases:</strong> Assessment may occur on the day of surgery, provided all necessary information is available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inpatients:</strong> Assessment should occur at the bedside ideally the day before surgery, or at minimum prior to transfer to the OR.</li>
                        <li><strong>Day-of-Procedure Update:</strong> Regardless of when the initial assessment was done, an "Immediate Pre-Induction Re-evaluation" must be documented on the day of the procedure to confirm NPO status, vital signs, and any interval changes in health.</li>

                        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Rapid administration of induction agent followed immediately by neuromuscular blocker (Succinylcholine or Rocuronium).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cricoid Pressure (Sellick Maneuver):</strong> May be applied (10N awake, 30N asleep) but should be released if it impedes ventilation or visualization (DAS 2025). Evidence for efficacy is variable; safety priority is oxygenation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Avoid positive pressure ventilation prior to intubation unless hypoxia ensues (Modified RSI may allow gentle ventilation &lt; 15-20 cmH2O).</li>
                        <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Confirmation of tube placement via capnography before release of cricoid pressure (if used).</li>

                    <p>Induction in NORA locations carries specific risks due to remote location, limited help, and ergonomic constraints.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Airway Access:</strong> Ensure airway is accessible (e.g., turning patient 180 degrees in MRI, away from fluoroscopy equipment).</li>
                        <li><strong>Emergency Plan:</strong> Verify location of code cart, difficult airway equipment, and evacuation route/plan before induction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backup:</strong> Identify method to call for help (phone, intercom) as standard OR call systems may not be available.</li>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">8.1 Standard Extubation Criteria</h3>
                    <p>Extubation should be performed only when the following safety criteria are met:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Oxygenation:</strong> SpO2 &gt; 92-95% on FiO2 ≤ 0.5 (or return to baseline).</li>
                        <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Spontaneous respiration with adequate tidal volume (&gt; 5 mL/kg) and respiratory rate (&lt; 30/min). Normal ETCO2.</li>
                        <li><strong>Airway Reflexes:</strong> Return of gag/cough reflexes and ability to swallow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Neuromuscular Recovery:</strong> <strong>Quantitative TOF Ratio ≥ 0.9</strong> or sustained tetanus/head lift &gt; 5 seconds (if quantitative not available).</li>
                        <li><strong>Consciousness:</strong> Patient responsive to command (e.g., "Open your eyes", "Squeeze hand") or follows procedure-specific criteria (e.g., deep extubation).</li>
                        <li><strong>Hemodynamics:</strong> Stable BP and HR.</li>
                        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Core temperature &gt; 36.0°C.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">8.2 Extubation Techniques</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Awake Extubation:</strong> Standard for most patients, especially those with difficult airway or aspiration risk. Tube removed after patient follows commands.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deep Extubation:</strong> May be considered for patients at risk of coughing-induced complications (e.g., hernia repair, eye surgery, neurosurgery) provided airway is not difficult and aspiration risk is low. Patient must be spontaneously breathing and deep enough to tolerate oral airway/suction without reaction.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">8.3 High-Risk Extubation Planning</h3>
                    <p>For patients with a known difficult airway or risk of airway edema (e.g., prone case &gt; 6 hours, large fluid shifts, anaphylaxis):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Formulate a specific extubation strategy (e.g., extubation over Airway Exchange Catheter (AEC), fully awake sitting up).</li>
                        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Consider extubation in ICU rather than OR.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Difficult airway cart and re-intubation drugs must be immediately available.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">9.1 Standard</h3>
                    <p>Residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) is a significant patient safety risk. <strong>ASA 2023 Guidelines</strong> strongly recommend quantitative monitoring and routine reversal.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">9.2 Monitoring</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Monitoring:</strong> Objective monitoring (e.g., acceleromyography, EMG) providing a numeric TOF ratio is the gold standard and should be used whenever non-depolarizing NMB agents are administered.</li>
                        <li><strong>Site:</strong> Monitoring at the ulnar nerve (adductor pollicis) is preferred for recovery assessment. Facial nerve monitoring may underestimate the degree of blockade at the diaphragm/pharynx.</li>
                        <li><strong>Target:</strong> A TOF ratio ≥ 0.9 is required before extubation to ensure adequate airway protection and respiratory function.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2">9.3 Reversal</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sugammadex:</strong> Preferred reversal agent for Rocuronium/Vecuronium, especially for deep block. Dosing based on depth of block (2 mg/kg for moderate, 4 mg/kg for deep).</li>
                        <li><strong>Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate:</strong> Indicated for reversal of moderate block (TOF count ≥ 2-3). Should NOT be used for deep block (TOF count 0). Allow at least 10 minutes for peak effect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Document the reversal agent, dose, time, and the post-reversal TOF ratio.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold border-b border-slate-300 pb-1 mt-6 mb-4">1. INTRODUCTION &amp; PURPOSE</h2>
                    <p>The immediate post-anesthesia period is a critical phase of recovery characterized by significant physiologic changes and risks, including airway compromise, respiratory depression, hemodynamic instability, and emergence delirium. The purpose of this policy is to establish standardized, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) to ensure optimal safety, quality of care, and efficient recovery.</p>
                    <p>This policy mandates a systematic approach to post-anesthesia care consistent with the <strong>CBAHI National Standards for Perioperative Safety (POR)</strong>, specifically addressing requirements for continuous monitoring during recovery (POR.6.3) and standardized discharge using defined evidence-based criteria (POR.6.4). It aligns with the <strong>American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Standards for Postanesthesia Care</strong> (Amended October 23, 2024), which dictates that all patients who have received general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care shall receive appropriate postanesthesia management.</p>
                    <p>The primary objectives of these standards are to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure every patient receives continuous, vigilant monitoring by qualified personnel during the recovery phase.</li>
                        <li>Standardize the transfer of care (handover) process to reduce communication errors and loss of critical information.</li>
                        <li>Define quantitative physiologic criteria for recovery progression and discharge readiness (Phase I to Phase II/Ward/ICU).</li>
                        <li>Establish protocols for the prevention, early recognition, and management of common postoperative complications including pain, nausea/vomiting (PONV), hypothermia, and respiratory adverse events.</li>
                        <li>Provide clear escalation pathways for clinical deterioration.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These standards apply to all Phase I recovery care provided in the main PACU and any Non-Operating Room Anesthesia (NORA) recovery areas designated as providing Phase I level care. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory for all anesthesia professionals, PACU nursing staff, and perioperative team members involved in patient recovery.</p>

                    <p>The ASA Standards for Postanesthesia Care mandate that "A patient recovering from anesthesia shall be monitored and vital signs shall be recorded frequently as deemed appropriate by the anesthesiologist." Monitoring must be continuous and documented at intervals sufficient to detect deterioration early.</p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">6.2 Minimum Monitoring Elements (ASA-Aligned)</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Continuous Pulse Oximetry (SpO2):</strong> MANDATORY for all patients in Phase I recovery.</li>
                        <li><strong>Alarms:</strong> Audible alarms must be active (typically set low limit 90-92%).</li>
                        <li><strong>Clinical Assessment:</strong> Skin color and perfusion must be assessed regularly, recognizing limitations of pulse oximetry (lag time, motion artifact, poor perfusion).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>B. Ventilation Monitoring:</strong></p>
