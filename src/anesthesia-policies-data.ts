1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Overview: This policy establishes a standardized, evidence-based framework for the pre-procedure assessment and readiness verification of all patients undergoing anesthesia, regional anesthesia, monitored anesthesia care (MAC), or procedural sedation. This comprehensive protocol applies uniformly across all Operating Room (OR) and Non-Operating Room Anesthesia (NORA) environments within the healthcare organization. 
Key Objectives: The primary objective is to eliminate preventable peri-procedural harm through rigorous risk identification, physiological optimization, and systematic verification of patient readiness. This policy mandates structured clinical assessments to identify comorbidities, airway difficulties, aspiration risks, and medication interactions prior to the induction of anesthesia or sedation. 
Scope Statement: The mandate extends to all licensed independent practitioners, nurses, and technicians involved in the delivery or monitoring of anesthesia and procedural sedation. It encompasses elective, urgent, and emergency procedures performed in surgical suites, endoscopy units, interventional radiology labs, cardiac catheterization labs, and ambulatory surgery centers. 
Expected Outcomes: Implementation of this policy is expected to: 
Reduce the incidence of adverse anesthesia events, including aspiration, airway mismanagement, and medication errors. 
Standardize the definition of patient readiness to minimize day-of-surgery cancellations and delays. 
Ensure full compliance with national and international accreditation standards (e.g., CBAHI, JCI) regarding perioperative safety. 
Enhance interdisciplinary communication through mandatory checklists and standardized documentation. 
2. PURPOSE AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Detailed Purpose 
To ensure that every patient receiving anesthesia care or procedural sedation undergoes a rigorous, standardized pre-procedure evaluation. This process is designed to support safe anesthetic planning, facilitate risk reduction strategies, ensure valid informed consent, and verify correct patient/procedure/site identification across all clinical settings. 
2.2 Clinical Rationale 
Pre-anesthesia assessment is the cornerstone of perioperative safety. Scientific literature consistently demonstrates that inadequate pre-operative evaluation is a contributing factor in a significant proportion of anesthesia-related mortality and morbidity. A structured assessment allows for: 
Risk Stratification: Identification of patients with low physiological reserve who require enhanced monitoring or postoperative intensive care. 
Optimization: Opportunity to manage reversible conditions (e.g., hypertension, anemia, hyperglycemia) to improve outcomes. 
Airway Management Planning: Detection of anatomical predictors for difficult airway management, allowing for the mobilization of advanced airway equipment and personnel. 
Pharmacological Management: Prevention of adverse drug interactions and management of critical medications such as anticoagulants and insulin. 
2.3 Patient Safety Imperatives 
This policy operationalizes the "Universal Protocol" for preventing wrong-site, wrong-procedure, and wrong-person surgery. Furthermore, it addresses critical safety domains including pulmonary aspiration prevention (NPO guidelines), allergy verification, and infection control integration. 
2.4 Regulatory Compliance 
This document aligns organizational practice with the standards set forth by: 
CBAHI (Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions): Specifically standards regarding Perioperative Safety (POR).

Local anesthesia infiltration performed by a surgeon/proceduralist without systemic sedation. 
4. DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY 
4.1 Clinical Assessment Terms 
Pre-Anesthesia Assessment: A structured clinical evaluation performed by an anesthesia professional prior to the delivery of anesthesia care. It integrates history, physical exam, and diagnostics to formulate an anesthetic plan. 
Pre-Sedation Assessment: A comparable evaluation performed prior to procedural sedation, focusing on airway risk, sedation depth planning, and rescue capacity. 
Medication Reconciliation: The formal process of creating the most accurate list possible of all medications a patient is taking and comparing it against the physician's admission, transfer, and/or discharge orders. 
Time-Out: An immediate pause by the entire medical team just before the procedure starts (or incision is made) to verify patient identity, procedure, site, and critical safety concerns. 
4.2 ASA Physical Status (ASA-PS) Classification 
A global standard for categorizing the pre-operative physical fitness of patients. (Detailed classification provided in Section 6.2). 
4.3 Difficult Airway Terminology 
Difficult Airway: A clinical situation in which a conventionally trained anesthesiologist experiences difficulty with mask ventilation, difficulty with tracheal intubation, or both. 
Difficult Mask Ventilation: Inability to maintain oxygen saturation &gt;90% despite 100% oxygen and positive pressure ventilation, or inability to prevent gas flow reversal. 
Difficult Laryngoscopy: Inability to visualize any portion of the vocal cords after multiple attempts. 
4.4 NORA (Non-Operating Room Anesthesia) 
Administration of anesthesia or sedation in locations outside the traditional surgical suite. These areas often present unique challenges such as limited space, remote location from backup support, potential radiation hazards, and unfamiliar equipment. 
4.5 Day Surgery / Ambulatory Surgery 
A planned clinical pathway where the patient is admitted, undergoes a procedure, recovers, and is discharged to home on the same calendar day. Success relies on strict patient selection criteria regarding comorbidities and social support. 
5. POLICY STATEMENT 
The Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine mandates strict adherence to the following core principles. Failure to comply constitutes a breach of patient safety standards. 
Mandatory Assessment: A documented pre-anesthesia or pre-sedation assessment shall be completed for 100% of applicable patients prior to the induction of anesthesia or administration of sedation. 
ASA Classification: An ASA-PS classification score must be assigned and documented for every patient. 
Airway Evaluation: A focused airway assessment and risk stratification (Easy/Difficult/Uncertain) must be documented, with a specific management plan for any anticipated difficulty. 
Fasting Verification: Compliance with NPO guidelines must be verified. For urgent/emergency cases where fasting is compromised, a risk mitigation plan (e.g., Rapid Sequence Induction) must be documented. 
Medication Safety: Medication reconciliation and allergy verification are prerequisites for transfer to the procedural area. 
Testing Stewardship: Pre-operative testing should be driven by clinical indication and patient history, not by routine protocols. 
Informed Consent: Separate informed consent for anesthesia/sedation is required, distinct from the surgical consent, discussing specific anesthetic risks. 
Standardized Readiness: Patient acceptance into the OR/Procedure room is contingent upon the completion of a "Sign-In" safety check verifying identity, site, and consent. 
Ambulatory Safety: Day-surgery candidates must meet specific physiological and social criteria to ensure safe discharge. 
6. DETAILED PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS 
6.1 Pre-Anesthesia Assessment Protocol 
6.1.1 Timing Requirements 
Elective High-Risk/Complex Cases: Assessment should ideally occur in the Pre-Anesthesia Clinic (PAC) 1–14 days prior to surgery to allow for optimization. 
Elective Low-Risk Cases: Assessment may occur on the day of surgery, provided all necessary information is available. 
Inpatients: Assessment should occur at the bedside ideally the day before surgery, or at minimum prior to transfer to the OR. 
Day-of-Procedure Update: Regardless of when the initial assessment was done, an "Immediate Pre-Induction Re-evaluation" must be documented on the day of the procedure to confirm NPO status, vital signs, and any interval changes in health. 
6.1.2 Comprehensive Assessment Elements 
The pre-anesthesia evaluation must include documentation of: 
Domain 
Required Elements 
History 
Indication for procedure, allergies/reactions, current medications (dose/freq), past anesthetic history (complications, PONV, difficult airway, malignant hyperthermia), family history, smoking/alcohol/substance use. 
Review of Systems 
CV: Angina, arrhythmias, exercise tolerance (METs), HTN, CHF. 
Resp: Asthma, COPD, OSA (STOP-Bang), recent URI. 
Neuro: TIA/CVA, seizures, cognitive status. 
GI/Endo: Reflux, diabetes, thyroid, liver disease. 
Heme: Bleeding diathesis, anticoagulation. 
Physical Exam 
Vital signs, Height/Weight/BMI, Airway exam (Section 6.3), Cardiopulmonary auscultation, vascular access assessment. 
Anesthetic Plan 
Proposed technique (GA/Regional/MAC), monitoring level (standard vs. invasive), pain management strategy, PONV prophylaxis, postoperative disposition (Home/Ward/ICU). 
6.1.3 High-Risk Triggers for Escalation 
The following findings require discussion with a Consultant Anesthesiologist or Medical Director before proceeding: 
Active cardiac conditions (unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmia, severe valvular disease). 
New onset physiological instability (sepsis, shock, hypoxia). 
Malignant Hyperthermia history. 
Anticipated difficult airway in a setting with limited backup (NORA). 
6.1.4 NORA-Specific Additions 
For procedures in MRI, CT, or IR, the assessment must document: 
Access limitations: Patient positioning preventing airway access during the procedure. 
Environment: Presence of strong magnetic fields (MRI compatibility checks) or radiation. 
Remote location safety: Confirmation that emergency equipment (suction, O2, defibrillator) is immediately available. 
6.2 ASA Physical Status Classification 
The ASA-PS classification is mandatory for risk stratification and billing purposes. It is a reflection of the patient's pre-operative systemic health, not the risk of the surgery itself. 
Class 
Definition 
Examples 
ASA I 
A normal healthy patient. 
Healthy, non-smoking, no or minimal alcohol use. 
ASA II 
A patient with mild systemic disease. 
Mild diseases only without substantive functional limitations. Current smoker, social drinker, pregnancy, obesity (30 &lt; BMI &lt; 40), well-controlled DM/HTN, mild lung disease. 
ASA III 
A patient with severe systemic disease. 
Substantive functional limitations; One or more moderate to severe diseases. Poorly controlled DM/HTN, COPD, morbid obesity (BMI ≥40), active hepatitis, alcohol dependence/abuse, implanted pacemaker, moderate reduction of ejection fraction, ESRD undergoing regularly scheduled dialysis, history (&gt;3 months) of MI, CVA, TIA, or CAD/stents. 
ASA IV 
A patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life. 
Recent (&lt;3 months) MI, CVA, TIA, or CAD/stents, ongoing cardiac ischemia or severe valve dysfunction, severe reduction of ejection fraction, sepsis, DIC, ARD or ESRD not undergoing regularly scheduled dialysis. 
ASA V 
A moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation. 
Ruptured abdominal/thoracic aneurysm, massive trauma, intracranial bleed with mass effect, ischemic bowel in the face of significant cardiac pathology or multiple organ/system dysfunction. 
ASA VI 
A declared brain-dead patient whose organs are being removed for donor purposes. 
Organ harvest. 
Emergency Modifier (E): The addition of "E" denotes emergency surgery (e.g., ASA IIE). An emergency is defined as existing when delay in treatment of the patient would lead to a significant increase in the threat to life or body part. 
6.3 Airway Assessment and Difficult Airway Risk Stratification 
6.3.1 Airway History 
Review of previous anesthetic records is critical. Specific inquiries must include: 
History of difficult intubation or mask ventilation. 
Dental damage during prior anesthesia. 
History of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) or CPAP use. 
History of head/neck radiation or surgery. 
6.3.2 Focused Physical Examination 
The following metrics must be evaluated: 
Mouth Opening: Inter-incisor gap &lt; 3cm (approx. 3 finger breadths) suggests difficulty. 
Mallampati Classification (I-IV): Visualization of faucial pillars, uvula, and soft palate. 
Thyromental Distance: &lt; 6cm (3 finger breadths) suggests poor laryngeal axis alignment. 
Neck Mobility: Ability to extend neck (sniffing position). 
Dentition: Loose teeth, caps, bridges, or dentures. 
Mandibular Protrusion: Ability to protrude lower incisors beyond upper incisors (Upper Lip Bite Test). 
6.3.3 Risk Stratification 
Risk Level 
Criteria 
Required Action 
Low Risk 
No predictors identified. Normal anatomy. 
Standard airway plan. 
Intermediate Risk 
Single predictor (e.g., Obesity alone, or Mallampati III with good mobility). 
Availability of videolaryngoscope in room. Backup airway (LMA) ready. 
High Risk / Anticipated Difficult 
Multiple predictors, history of difficult airway, or pathology (tumor/abscess) distorting anatomy. 
AWAKE INTUBATION consideration. Videolaryngoscopy primary plan. Fiberoptic scope available. "Call for Help" designated person. Surgeon present for possible surgical airway (FONA). 
6.4 Pre-Procedure Fasting and Aspiration Risk Management 
6.4.1 Standard Fasting Guidelines (Elective Procedures) 
The following minimum fasting periods apply to healthy patients undergoing elective procedures to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration: 
Ingested Material 
Minimum Fasting Period 
Clear Liquids (Water, pulp-free juice, black coffee/tea, carbohydrate drinks) 
2 Hours 
Breast Milk 
4 Hours 
Infant Formula, Non-human Milk, Light Meal (Toast and clear liquid) 
6 Hours 
Full Meal (Fatty/Fried foods, meat) 
8 Hours or more 
6.4.2 Aspiration Risk Assessment 
Patients are classified as "Full Stomach" / High Aspiration Risk if: 
Fasting guidelines are not met (Emergency/Urgent cases). 
Delayed gastric emptying conditions exist: Severe pain/trauma, Opioid use, Diabetes (gastroparesis), Pregnancy (&gt;18 weeks), Bowel obstruction, GERD with active symptoms. 
6.4.3 Risk Mitigation 
For patients identified as High Aspiration Risk: 
Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI): Utilization of rapid-onset muscle relaxant (Succinylcholine/Rocuronium) and cricoid pressure (if deemed clinically appropriate) to secure airway rapidly. 
Awake Intubation: If difficult airway is also present. 
Nasogastric Decompression: Consideration for suctioning stomach contents prior to induction in bowel obstruction. 
6.5 Medication Reconciliation and Allergy Verification 
6.5.1 Reconciliation Process 
The anesthesia provider must verify the list of medications taken in the last 24 hours. Discrepancies between the patient's report and the medical record must be resolved. 
6.5.2 High-Risk Medication Protocols 
Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets: 
Warfarin: Check INR. Hold 5 days usually. 
DOACs (Apixaban/Rivaroxaban): Hold 48-72 hours depending on renal function and bleeding risk of surgery. 
Aspirin: Generally continued for cardiac patients; surgeon discretion for neurosurgery/spine. 
Diabetes Management: 
Oral Hypoglycemics: Hold on morning of surgery. (Metformin may be held 24h prior if contrast used). 
Insulin: Basal insulin often reduced (e.g., 50-80% of dose) night before/morning of. Short-acting insulin held while NPO. 
GLP-1 Agonists (e.g., Semaglutide): High risk for delayed gastric emptying. Hold for 1 week prior if possible; if not held, treat as "Full Stomach" precaution. 
ACE Inhibitors / ARBs: Often held on the morning of surgery to prevent refractory hypotension under anesthesia, unless used for heart failure control. 
6.5.3 Allergy Verification 
Specific attention must be paid to: 
Latex Allergy: Requires a latex-safe environment (removal of latex gloves, tourniquets, vial stoppers). 
Antibiotic Allergies: Distinguish between intolerance (nausea) and anaphylaxis/hives to guide prophylaxis choice. 
Propofol/Egg/Soy: Review severity; most patients with egg allergy can tolerate Propofol, but caution is warranted for anaphylaxis history. 
6.6 Pre-Operative Testing and Consultation Protocol 
Routine testing (panels) without clinical indication is discouraged. Testing guidelines based on NICE (NG45) and ASA recommendations: 
Test 
Indications 
ECG 
History of CAD, arrhythmia, or significant structural heart disease. Considered for age &gt;65 or &gt;50 with risk factors undergoing intermediate/high-risk surgery. 
Chest X-Ray 
New or unstable cardiopulmonary symptoms. Not routine for stable COPD/Asthma or smoking unless active infection suspected. 
CBC (Hemoglobin) 
Procedures with moderate/high bleeding risk, history of anemia, renal disease, malignancy. 
Coagulation (PT/PTT/INR) 
Anticoagulant therapy, liver disease, history of bleeding diathesis. Not routine. 
Electrolytes/Creatinine 
Renal disease, use of diuretics/ACE-I/ARBs, diabetes, potential for fluid shifts. 
Pregnancy Test 
All female patients of childbearing age (menarche to menopause) unless hysterectomy confirmed. Policy: "Opt-out" requires documented refusal after counseling. 
6.7 Informed Consent Process 
6.7.1 Separate Anesthesia Consent 
Informed consent for anesthesia is a distinct process from surgical consent. It must be documented by an anesthesia professional. 
6.7.2 Content of Discussion 
The discussion must cover: 
General Risks: Sore throat, nausea/vomiting, dental damage, drowsiness, shivering. 
Serious Risks: Aspiration, anaphylaxis, awareness, organ injury, nerve injury, cardiac arrest, death (rare). 
Regional Anesthesia Specifics: Nerve damage, bleeding/hematoma, infection, failure of block, toxicity (LAST), post-dural puncture headache. 
Blood Products: Consent for transfusion if hemorrhage occurs. 
6.7.3 Emergency Exception 
In life-threatening emergencies where the patient is incapacitated and no surrogate is available, implied consent applies. This must be documented in the medical record as "Emergency procedure necessary to preserve life/limb." 
6.8 Patient Acceptance and Safety Verification 
6.8.1 The Checklist Workflow 
Implementation of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist (modified for local context) is mandatory. 
Sign-In (Pre-Induction): 
Patient confirms identity, site, procedure, and consent. 
Site is marked by surgeon (if laterality applies). 
Anesthesia machine and medication safety check completed. 
Pulse oximeter on and functioning. 
Allergies re-confirmed. 
Difficult airway/aspiration risk reviewed. 
Time-Out (Pre-Incision): 
All team members stop. 
Introductions (names and roles). 
Surgeon, Anesthetist, and Nurse verbally confirm patient, site, and procedure. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis confirmed (administered within 60 min). 
Critical imaging displayed. 
6.8.2 "Stop the Line" Authority 
Any team member (nurse, technician, surgeon, anesthetist) has the authority and obligation to halt the procedure if a safety breach or discrepancy is identified during verification. No retribution shall occur for safety stops. 
6.9 Day Surgery Selection and Discharge Planning 
6.9.1 Patient Selection (Exclusion Criteria) 
Patients are generally NOT suitable for ambulatory/day surgery if: 
ASA Class IV (unstable). 
Morbid obesity (BMI &gt;40 or &gt;35 with comorbidities) with severe OSA and non-compliant with CPAP. 
Infants &lt; 60 weeks post-conceptual age (risk of post-anesthetic apnea). 
No responsible adult escort for discharge. 
Malignant Hyperthermia susceptibility (requires extended observation). 
6.9.2 Discharge Criteria (e.g., PADSS - Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring System) 
Patients must score ≥9/10 to be discharged: 
Vital Signs: Within 20% of baseline. 
Ambulation: Steady gait, no dizziness. 
Nausea/Vomiting: Minimal/treated. 
Pain: Acceptable control with oral analgesics. 
Surgical Bleeding: Minimal/consistent with expectation. 
7. SPECIAL POPULATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
7.1 Pediatric Patients 
Assessment: Focus on recent URI (risk of laryngospasm). URI within 2 weeks may require postponement of elective cases if symptoms are severe (fever, wet cough). 
Fasting: Strict adherence to minimizing fasting times (Clear fluids up to 1 hour allowed in some modern pediatric protocols, but standard policy is 2 hours). 
Consent: Obtained from parent/legal guardian. Assent from older children is encouraged. 
7.2 Obstetric Patients 
Physiology: Always considered "Full Stomach" after 18-20 weeks gestation due to hormonal and mechanical factors. RSI required for GA. 
Fetal Monitoring: Pre- and post-procedure fetal heart rate check required for non-obstetric surgery during pregnancy. 
7.3 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) 
Screening: STOP-Bang questionnaire used for all adults. 
Management: High-risk OSA patients should bring home CPAP machine. Opioid-sparing analgesia (Multimodal) is critical. Consideration for extended monitoring (overnight) if apnea episodes occur in PACU. 
7.4 Patients with Implanted Devices (CIEDs) 
Pacemakers/ICDs: Device type and dependency must be established. Electrocautery (Bovie) can interfere. Magnet application plan or reprogramming to asynchronous mode (VOO/DOO) may be required.

1. INTRODUCTION &amp; REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 
1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this policy is to establish comprehensive, evidence-based standards for the safe conduct of anesthesia in all intraoperative settings. This document mandates standardized processes for minimum monitoring, documentation, induction safety, maintenance of physiological stability, and safe emergence to minimize perioperative morbidity and mortality. It integrates rigorous safety checks, including the World Health Organization (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist, into the workflow of anesthesia care to ensure correct patient, procedure, and site verification, as well as readiness for critical events. 
1.2 Scope 
This policy applies to all anesthesia services provided within the institution, encompassing: 
Operating Rooms (OR): All main surgical suites, ambulatory surgery centers, and specialty ORs (Cardiac, Neuro, Orthopedic). 
Non-Operating Room Anesthesia (NORA) Locations: All procedural areas where anesthesia services are delivered, including but not limited to:
Gastroenterology/Endoscopy Suites (EGD, Colonoscopy, ERCP) 
Interventional Radiology (IR) and Neuro-Interventional Suites 
Cardiac Catheterization and Electrophysiology Labs 
Diagnostic Imaging (MRI, CT) 
Bronchoscopy Suites 
Psychiatry (ECT) 
Emergency Department and Trauma Bays (when anesthesia team is involved) 
This policy applies to all anesthesia professionals (anesthesiologists, CRNAs, anesthesia residents/fellows) and support staff involved in intraoperative care. 
1.3 Regulatory Alignment &amp; Evidence Base 
This policy is strictly aligned with the following national and international standards: 
CBAHI (Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions): Perioperative Safety Standards (POR.10, POR.11), requiring standardized protocols for monitoring, sedation, and documentation. 
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA): Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring (Last Amended Oct 15, 2025) and Statement on Documentation of Anesthesia Care (2020). 
Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA): PG18(A) Guideline on Monitoring During Anaesthesia (2025 Edition). 
European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC): Intra-operative Haemodynamic Monitoring and Management Guidelines (2025).

2. DEFINITIONS &amp; TERMINOLOGY 
Term 
Definition 
Anesthesia Professional 
A qualified physician (anesthesiologist) or nurse anesthetist (CRNA/Advanced Practice Nurse) credentialed and privileged to provide anesthesia services. 
Minimum Monitoring Standards 
The mandatory baseline physiologic monitoring required for all patients under general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care (MAC), comprising continuous evaluation of oxygenation, ventilation, circulation, and temperature. 
Continual vs. Continuous 
Continual: Repeated regularly and frequently in steady rapid succession (e.g., non-invasive blood pressure every 5 minutes). Continuous: Prolonged without any interruption at any time (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, capnography). 
Induction Phase 
The transition from a state of baseline consciousness to the anesthetized state, involving administration of hypnotic agents and airway management. 
Maintenance Phase 
The period of anesthesia following induction until the beginning of emergence, focusing on maintaining anesthetic depth, physiologic stability, and analgesia. 
Emergence Phase 
The transition from the anesthetized state to wakefulness and restoration of protective reflexes, culminating in extubation or removal of airway devices. 
Neuromuscular Blockade (NMB) Terms 
TOF (Train-of-Four): Four supramaximal electrical stimuli delivered to a peripheral nerve. TOF Ratio: The ratio of the amplitude of the 4th twitch to the 1st twitch. Residual Paralysis: TOF ratio &lt; 0.9, indicating incomplete recovery from NMB. 
Quantitative Monitoring 
Objective measurement of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., acceleromyography) yielding a numeric TOF ratio, as opposed to subjective visual/tactile assessment (qualitative). 
Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) 
A specialized induction technique designed to minimize the time between loss of protective airway reflexes and tracheal intubation to reduce aspiration risk, typically involving preoxygenation, rapid administration of induction/paralytic agents, and optional cricoid pressure. 
3. POLICY STATEMENTS

4.2 Continuous Presence: A qualified anesthesia professional shall be continuously present in the room throughout the conduct of all general anesthetics, regional anesthetics, and monitored anesthesia care to monitor the patient and provide immediate intervention. 
4.3 Minimum Monitoring Standards: All patients receiving anesthesia care shall be monitored in accordance with ASA and ANZCA standards, including continuous evaluation of oxygenation, ventilation, circulation, and temperature. These standards apply equally to OR and NORA settings. 
4.4 Documentation Integrity: Intra-anesthesia documentation shall be accurate, contemporaneous, and complete, capturing all physiologic trends, medication administrations, interventions, and critical events to support continuity of care and medico-legal integrity. 
4.5 Induction Safety: Induction of anesthesia shall be preceded by a safety verification check (Sign-In) and shall utilize risk-stratified protocols for aspiration prevention (RSI) and hemodynamic stability. 
4.6 Maintenance Management: Anesthetic maintenance shall target optimal physiological parameters, including normothermia, euglycemia, and hemodynamic stability within 20% of baseline, tailored to patient comorbidities. 
4.7 Emergence Safety: Extubation shall proceed only when predefined criteria for airway protection, ventilation, oxygenation, and hemodynamic stability are met. High-risk extubations require a documented plan. 
4.8 Neuromuscular Blockade Management: Quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular blockade is required when NMB agents are used. Pharmacologic reversal is mandatory unless objective criteria for spontaneous recovery (TOF ratio ≥ 0.9) are met and documented. 
4.9 Glucose Management: Intraoperative glucose levels shall be monitored in indicated patients, targeting a range of 140-180 mg/dL (general) or 180-250 mg/dL (ambulatory consensus) to prevent hypoglycemia and reduce infection risk. 
4.10 Antibiotic Prophylaxis: The anesthesia team shall verify and document the administration of prophylactic antibiotics within the appropriate pre-incision window (typically 60 minutes) as part of the surgical safety checklist. 
4.11 Verification Support: The anesthesia professional shall actively participate in the "Time-Out" and "Sign-Out" phases of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist to verify patient identity, procedure, implants, and specimens. 
4. MINIMUM MONITORING STANDARDS

Capnography/Capnometry (End-Tidal CO2) 
Mandatory Requirement: Continuous quantitative monitoring of expired carbon dioxide (capnography/capnometry) shall be performed from the time of endotracheal tube/supraglottic airway device placement until extubation or transfer (ASA 2025, ANZCA 2025). 
Waveform Analysis: Waveform capnography is strongly encouraged to detect obstruction, rebreathing, and circuit disconnection. 
Sedation: During moderate or deep sedation, adequacy of ventilation shall be evaluated by continual observation of qualitative clinical signs, and monitoring for the presence of exhaled carbon dioxide shall be employed unless precluded by the nature of the patient, procedure, or equipment. 
Alarms: An audible alarm for loss of CO2 or high/low ETCO2 limits must be active. 
Mechanical Ventilator Monitoring 
Disconnect Alarm: When mechanical ventilation is used, there shall be in continuous use a device capable of detecting disconnection of components of the breathing system. The device must give an audible signal when its alarm threshold is exceeded. 
Parameters: Tidal volume, respiratory rate, and airway pressures (peak/plateau) should be monitored and displayed. 
Airway Device Position Confirmation 
Correct positioning of an endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway must be verified by clinical assessment (auscultation, chest rise) AND identification of carbon dioxide in the expired gas. Continuous capnography shall be used for ongoing verification. 
4.4 Circulation Monitoring 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
Requirement: Every patient receiving anesthesia shall have the electrocardiogram continuously displayed from the beginning of anesthesia until preparing to leave the anesthetizing location (ASA 2025). 
Lead Selection: Lead II (rhythm detection) and V5 (ischemia detection) are recommended for most adult patients. 
Blood Pressure Monitoring 
Requirement: Arterial blood pressure and heart rate shall be determined and evaluated at least every 5 minutes (ASA 2025). 
Frequency: More frequent measurement (e.g., every 1-3 minutes) is indicated during induction, emergence, and periods of hemodynamic instability. 
Invasive Monitoring: Continuous invasive arterial pressure monitoring is indicated for deliberate hypotension, major hemodynamic instability, or frequent blood sampling. 
Additional Circulatory Evaluation 
Every patient receiving general anesthesia shall have circulatory function continually evaluated by at least one of the following additional methods: palpation of a pulse, auscultation of heart sounds, monitoring of a tracing of intra-arterial pressure, ultrasound peripheral pulse monitoring, or pulse plethysmography/oximetry. 
4.5 Temperature Monitoring 
Requirement: Every patient receiving anesthesia shall have temperature monitored when clinically significant changes in body temperature are intended, anticipated, or suspected (ASA 2025). 
Indications: General anesthesia &gt; 30-60 minutes, regional anesthesia with risk of hypothermia, pediatric patients.

6. INDUCTION SAFETY PROTOCOLS 
6.1 Pre-Induction Safety Verification 
Before induction of anesthesia, the "Sign-In" phase of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist must be completed. This includes: 
Confirmation of patient identity (two identifiers). 
Confirmation of procedure, site, and side. 
Verification of consent. 
Confirmation of fasting status (NPO). 
Check of anesthesia machine and suction. 
Verification of airway difficulty and aspiration risk. 
Confirmation of known allergies. 
Verification of functional pulse oximeter on patient. 
6.2 Hemodynamic Safeguards for High-Risk Induction 
Patients at risk for induction-related hypotension (e.g., sepsis, hypovolemia, cardiomyopathy, elderly) require a modified induction strategy: 
Preparation: Pre-induction fluid loading if indicated. Vasopressors (Phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Norepinephrine) drawn up and immediately available. 
Medication Selection: Dose reduction of propofol or use of alternative agents (Etomidate, Ketamine). Titration to effect rather than bolus dosing. 
Monitoring: Consideration for pre-induction arterial line placement for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring. 
6.3 Aspiration Risk Mitigation &amp; RSI Protocols 
Risk Assessment: All patients must be assessed for aspiration risk (e.g., full stomach, bowel obstruction, GERD, pregnancy, morbid obesity, diabetes/gastroparesis). 
Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI): Indicated for patients at increased risk of aspiration. 
Preoxygenation: Mandatory to achieve ETO2 &gt; 80% or 3-5 minutes of tidal breathing. 
Technique: Rapid administration of induction agent followed immediately by neuromuscular blocker (Succinylcholine or Rocuronium). 
Cricoid Pressure (Sellick Maneuver): May be applied (10N awake, 30N asleep) but should be released if it impedes ventilation or visualization (DAS 2025). Evidence for efficacy is variable; safety priority is oxygenation. 
Ventilation: Avoid positive pressure ventilation prior to intubation unless hypoxia ensues (Modified RSI may allow gentle ventilation &lt; 15-20 cmH2O). 
Confirmation: Confirmation of tube placement via capnography before release of cricoid pressure (if used). 
6.4 NORA Induction Considerations 
Induction in NORA locations carries specific risks due to remote location, limited help, and ergonomic constraints. 
Airway Access: Ensure airway is accessible (e.g., turning patient 180 degrees in MRI, away from fluoroscopy equipment). 
Emergency Plan: Verify location of code cart, difficult airway equipment, and evacuation route/plan before induction. 
Backup: Identify method to call for help (phone, intercom) as standard OR call systems may not be available. 
7. MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA 
7.1 Anesthetic Depth Management 
Volatile Agents: Maintain appropriate MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration) adjusted for age to ensure amnesia (typically &gt; 0.5-0.7 MAC). 
TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia): When TIVA is used (e.g., Propofol/Remifentanil), use of processed EEG monitoring (e.g., BIS, Entropy) is recommended to reduce the risk of awareness and prevent overdose. 
Monitoring: Continually assess clinical signs (HR, BP, sweating, lacrimation) and consider depth of anesthesia monitoring for high-risk patients (paralyzed, hemodynamically unstable). 
7.2 Oxygenation &amp; Ventilation Management 
Oxygenation: Maintain SpO2 &gt; 94% (or patient baseline). Use lowest effective FiO2 to avoid absorption atelectasis and toxicity, except during induction/emergence. 
Protective Ventilation: Utilize lung-protective ventilation strategies:
Tidal Volume: 6-8 mL/kg predicted body weight. 
PEEP: 5-10 cmH2O (individualized). 
Recruitment maneuvers: As indicated to treat atelectasis. 
Plateau Pressure: &lt; 30 cmH2O. 
7.3 Hemodynamic Management 
Targets: Maintain Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) within 20% of preoperative baseline or MAP &gt; 65 mmHg, whichever is higher, to ensure organ perfusion. 
Hypotension: Treat promptly with fluids, vasopressors, or inotropes. Prolonged hypotension is associated with AKI, myocardial injury, and stroke. 
Hypertension: Assess for pain, light anesthesia, or hypercarbia before treating with antihypertensives. 
Fluid Management: Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) using dynamic parameters (PPV, SVV) is recommended for major surgery. 
7.4 Temperature Management 
Hypothermia Prevention: Maintain core temperature ≥ 36.0°C. 
Interventions: Active warming (forced-air warming blankets), fluid warmers, and increasing ambient room temperature should be employed for cases &gt; 30 minutes. 
Monitoring: Continuous temperature monitoring is required for all general anesthetics &gt; 30 minutes. 
7.5 Multimodal Analgesia &amp; PONV Prevention 
Analgesia: Utilize a multimodal approach (Opioids, Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, Regional Blockade, Ketamine, Dexamethasone, Lidocaine) to improve pain control and reduce opioid side effects. 
PONV: Assess risk (Apfel score). Administer prophylactic antiemetics (e.g., Ondansetron, Dexamethasone) for moderate/high-risk patients. 
8. EMERGENCE &amp; EXTUBATION PROTOCOLS 
8.1 Standard Extubation Criteria 
Extubation should be performed only when the following safety criteria are met: 
Oxygenation: SpO2 &gt; 92-95% on FiO2 ≤ 0.5 (or return to baseline). 
Ventilation: Spontaneous respiration with adequate tidal volume (&gt; 5 mL/kg) and respiratory rate (&lt; 30/min). Normal ETCO2. 
Airway Reflexes: Return of gag/cough reflexes and ability to swallow. 
Neuromuscular Recovery: Quantitative TOF Ratio ≥ 0.9 or sustained tetanus/head lift &gt; 5 seconds (if quantitative not available). 
Consciousness: Patient responsive to command (e.g., "Open your eyes", "Squeeze hand") or follows procedure-specific criteria (e.g., deep extubation). 
Hemodynamics: Stable BP and HR. 
Temperature: Core temperature &gt; 36.0°C. 
8.2 Extubation Techniques 
Awake Extubation: Standard for most patients, especially those with difficult airway or aspiration risk. Tube removed after patient follows commands. 
Deep Extubation: May be considered for patients at risk of coughing-induced complications (e.g., hernia repair, eye surgery, neurosurgery) provided airway is not difficult and aspiration risk is low. Patient must be spontaneously breathing and deep enough to tolerate oral airway/suction without reaction. 
8.3 High-Risk Extubation Planning 
For patients with a known difficult airway or risk of airway edema (e.g., prone case &gt; 6 hours, large fluid shifts, anaphylaxis): 
Plan: Formulate a specific extubation strategy (e.g., extubation over Airway Exchange Catheter (AEC), fully awake sitting up). 
Location: Consider extubation in ICU rather than OR. 
Equipment: Difficult airway cart and re-intubation drugs must be immediately available. 
9. NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE MONITORING &amp; REVERSAL 
9.1 Standard 
Residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) is a significant patient safety risk. ASA 2023 Guidelines strongly recommend quantitative monitoring and routine reversal. 
9.2 Monitoring 
Quantitative Monitoring: Objective monitoring (e.g., acceleromyography, EMG) providing a numeric TOF ratio is the gold standard and should be used whenever non-depolarizing NMB agents are administered. 
Site: Monitoring at the ulnar nerve (adductor pollicis) is preferred for recovery assessment. Facial nerve monitoring may underestimate the degree of blockade at the diaphragm/pharynx. 
Target: A TOF ratio ≥ 0.9 is required before extubation to ensure adequate airway protection and respiratory function. 
9.3 Reversal 
Sugammadex: Preferred reversal agent for Rocuronium/Vecuronium, especially for deep block. Dosing based on depth of block (2 mg/kg for moderate, 4 mg/kg for deep). 
Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate: Indicated for reversal of moderate block (TOF count ≥ 2-3). Should NOT be used for deep block (TOF count 0). Allow at least 10 minutes for peak effect. 
Documentation: Document the reversal agent, dose, time, and the post-reversal TOF ratio. 
10. INTRAOPERATIVE GLUCOSE MANAGEMENT 
10.1 Indications &amp; Targets 
Indications: Known diabetes (Type 1 or 2), patients on insulin, major surgery &gt; 2 hours, sepsis, trauma, or patients receiving high-dose steroids. 
Targets: 
General Target: 140 - 180 mg/dL. 
Ambulatory Consensus (SAMBA): 180 - 250 mg/dL is acceptable to minimize hypoglycemia risk. 
Hypoglycemia: &lt; 70 mg/dL (Requires immediate treatment). 
Severe Hyperglycemia: &gt; 250 mg/dL (Consider treatment). 
10.2 Protocol 
Monitoring Frequency: Check baseline BG. Recheck every 1-2 hours for stable patients, every 30-60 minutes for patients on insulin infusions or with lability. 
Treatment: 
Hypoglycemia (&lt; 70 mg/dL): Administer Dextrose 50% (D50) 25-50 mL IV or Dextrose 10% infusion. Recheck in 15 minutes. 
Hyperglycemia (&gt; 180-200 mg/dL): Treat with subcutaneous or intravenous Regular Insulin (e.g., 2-4 units IV) per sliding scale or start insulin infusion for persistent elevation. 
11. ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS TIMING VERIFICATION 
11.1 Requirement 
Surgical site infection (SSI) prevention requires timely antibiotic administration. The anesthesia provider is responsible for ensuring administration within the correct window. 
11.2 Timing 
Standard (Cefazolin, etc.): Administer within 60 minutes prior to surgical incision. 
Vancomycin/Fluoroquinolones: Administer within 120 minutes prior to incision (due to longer infusion times). 
11.3 Redosing 
Antibiotics must be redosed intraoperatively based on the drug's half-life (usually every 2 half-lives) or excessive blood loss (&gt; 1500 mL). (e.g., Cefazolin redose every 4 hours). 
11.4 Checklist Integration 
Administration status is verbally confirmed during the "Sign-In" and "Time-Out" phases of the Surgical Safety Checklist. 
12. SPECIMEN, IMAGING &amp; IMPLANT VERIFICATION 
12.1 Specimen Verification (Sign-Out) 
During the "Sign-Out" phase (before the patient leaves the OR), the anesthesia provider participates in verifying: 
Correct specimen labeling (Patient Name, MRN, Site, Specimen Name). 
Any specimen-related issues are addressed. 
12.2 Imaging &amp; Implants (Time-Out) 
Imaging: Verification that essential imaging is displayed. 
Implants: Confirmation that correct implants are available (Time-Out). Anesthesia ensures patient stability for implantation (e.g., hemodynamics for cement). 
14. ROLES &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES 
Anesthesia Professional: Solely responsible for continuous monitoring, anesthetic management, medication administration, accurate documentation, and leading safety checks related to anesthesia. 
Surgeon: Responsible for communicating surgical steps, duration, and critical events (bleeding, stimulus) to the anesthesia team. 
Circulating Nurse: Responsible for assisting with equipment, verifying checklist items, and documenting surgical times. 
Anesthesia Technician: Responsible for equipment maintenance, supply availability, and assisting with technical procedures (lines, airway). 
15. DOCUMENTATION &amp; RECORDS 
The Anesthesia Record is a permanent part of the patient's medical chart. It must be completed for every case. Incomplete records will be flagged for completion within 24 hours. 
16. QUALITY ASSURANCE &amp; COMPLIANCE MONITORING 
16.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
The department will audit the following metrics quarterly: 
Monitoring Compliance: 100% of cases with continuous SpO2, NIBP, ECG, and ETCO2 (for GA). 
Documentation Completeness: &gt; 95% of charts with all 25 required elements. 
Antibiotic Timing: &gt; 95% of eligible cases with Abx within 60 min of incision. 
Normothermia: &gt; 90% of patients normothermic (36-38°C) at end of surgery. 
NMB Reversal: &gt; 95% of cases with documented reversal or TOF ≥ 0.9.

1. INTRODUCTION &amp; PURPOSE 
The immediate post-anesthesia period is a critical phase of recovery characterized by significant physiologic changes and risks, including airway compromise, respiratory depression, hemodynamic instability, and emergence delirium. The purpose of this policy is to establish standardized, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) to ensure optimal safety, quality of care, and efficient recovery. 
This policy mandates a systematic approach to post-anesthesia care consistent with the CBAHI National Standards for Perioperative Safety (POR) , specifically addressing requirements for continuous monitoring during recovery (POR.6.3) and standardized discharge using defined evidence-based criteria (POR.6.4). It aligns with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Standards for Postanesthesia Care (Amended October 23, 2024), which dictates that all patients who have received general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care shall receive appropriate postanesthesia management. 
The primary objectives of these standards are to: 
Ensure every patient receives continuous, vigilant monitoring by qualified personnel during the recovery phase. 
Standardize the transfer of care (handover) process to reduce communication errors and loss of critical information. 
Define quantitative physiologic criteria for recovery progression and discharge readiness (Phase I to Phase II/Ward/ICU). 
Establish protocols for the prevention, early recognition, and management of common postoperative complications including pain, nausea/vomiting (PONV), hypothermia, and respiratory adverse events. 
Provide clear escalation pathways for clinical deterioration. 
These standards apply to all Phase I recovery care provided in the main PACU and any Non-Operating Room Anesthesia (NORA) recovery areas designated as providing Phase I level care. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory for all anesthesia professionals, PACU nursing staff, and perioperative team members involved in patient recovery. 
2. SCOPE &amp; APPLICABILITY 
2.1 Patient Populations 
This policy applies to all adult and pediatric patients recovering from: 
General Anesthesia (GA) with or without airway instrumentation. 
Regional/Neuraxial Anesthesia (Spinal, Epidural, Peripheral Nerve Blocks) with or without sedation. 
Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC). 
Procedural Sedation managed by anesthesia services (Moderate/Deep Sedation). 
2.2 Clinical Locations 
This policy applies to: 
Main PACU (Phase I): The primary high-acuity recovery area. 
Phase II Recovery Area: Step-down unit for ambulatory surgery discharge preparation (where applicable). 
NORA Recovery Areas: Endoscopy, Interventional Radiology, Cath Lab, MRI, and other procedural suites providing post-anesthesia recovery. 
ICU/CCU: When a patient bypasses PACU for direct admission, PACU standards for handover and immediate recovery monitoring apply during the initial stabilization phase. 
2.3 Personnel 
This policy applies to Anesthesiologists, Anesthesia Technicians/Technologists, PACU Registered Nurses, Respiratory Therapists, and receiving unit nursing staff (Ward/ICU). 
3. DEFINITIONS 
PACU Phase I: The immediate high-intensity level of care following anesthesia, focusing on airway protection, hemodynamic stabilization, pain control, and neurological recovery. Staffing ratio typically 1:2 (or 1:1 for unstable/unconscious patients). 
PACU Phase II: A lower-intensity level of care for patients who have met Phase I discharge criteria, focusing on preparation for discharge home (ambulatory surgery) or to an unmonitored ward. Staffing ratio typically 1:3-5. 
Aldrete Score (Modified): A standardized quantitative tool used to assess physiologic recovery and readiness for discharge from Phase I, evaluating activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness, and oxygen saturation. 
Structured Handover: A formalized process of transferring patient information and responsibility using a standardized framework (e.g., SBAR, I-PASS) to ensure completeness and accuracy. 
Opioid-Induced Ventilatory Impairment (OIVI): A spectrum of opioid side effects ranging from mild hypoventilation to severe respiratory depression and apnea, often preceding oxygen desaturation. 
Unplanned ICU Admission: Admission to an intensive care unit from the PACU for a patient originally scheduled for ward admission or discharge home, due to intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. 
Postoperative Respiratory Complication (PRC): Any adverse respiratory event including aspiration, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, hypoventilation, hypoxia, or re-intubation. 
4. REGULATORY &amp; EVIDENCE FRAMEWORK 
This policy is founded on international standards and evidence-based guidelines: 
CBAHI National Standards (POR): Mandates standardized recovery monitoring, documentation, and discharge criteria. 
ASA Standards for Postanesthesia Care (2024): Defines requirements for patient transport, handover, continuous monitoring (oxygenation, ventilation, circulation, temperature), and physician supervision. 
ASA Practice Guidelines for Postanesthetic Care (2013): Provides recommendations for monitoring, antagonism of neuromuscular blockade, and management of emergence. 
APSF &amp; Joint Commission Guidelines: Emphasize standardized handoff communication (SBAR) to prevent medical errors. 
Fourth Consensus Guidelines for the Management of PONV (Gan et al., 2020): Protocols for risk assessment, prophylaxis, and rescue treatment. 
NICE Clinical Guideline [CG65] (2016): Hypothermia prevention and management in adults having surgery. 
Difficult Airway Society (DAS) Guidelines: Management of extubation and airway crises in recovery. 
5. PACU ADMISSION &amp; HANDOVER PROTOCOLS (D1) 
5.1 Transport and Accompaniment Requirements 
In accordance with ASA Standards, all patients shall be transported from the anesthetizing location to the PACU accompanied by a member of the anesthesia care team who is knowledgeable about the patient's condition. The anesthesia provider shall remain with the patient until vital signs have been measured, the patient is stable, and the transfer of care (handover) to the PACU nurse is completed. 
Monitoring During Transport: Continuous pulse oximetry and clinical observation of airway/ventilation are mandatory. Supplemental oxygen shall be provided for all patients who received general anesthesia or deep sedation. 
High-Risk Transport: For unstable patients, continuous ECG and hemodynamic monitoring shall be maintained during transport. Emergency airway equipment and drugs must be immediately available. 
5.2 Immediate Arrival Assessment (First 3-5 Minutes) 
Upon arrival in the PACU, the following actions must be performed immediately (concurrent with handover):

4. Current Status (Assessment): Most recent BP/HR/SpO2, ventilatory status, residual sedation. 
5. Analgesia Plan (Assessment): Regional blocks (type/level), Opioids given (total dose/time of last dose), Non-opioids given, PCA plan, Pain score. 
6. PONV Risk (Assessment): Risk level, Prophylaxis given, Rescue plan. 
7. Neuromuscular Blockade (Assessment): Agent used, Reversal given (Neostigmine vs Sugammadex), Adequacy (TOF ratio). 
8. Fluids &amp; Hemodynamics (Assessment): Total fluids given, EBL, Urine output, Vasopressor infusions. 
9. Antibiotics (Background): Dose/time given, Redosing requirements. 
10. Temperature (Assessment): Current temp, Active warming status. 
11. Surgical Concerns (Assessment): Drains/Dressings, Specific positioning/immobilization instructions.

13. Allergies (Background): Drug/Latex allergies. 
14. Family (Situation): Notification status. 
15. Questions (Interactive): Opportunity for PACU nurse to clarify information. 
5.4 PACU Nurse Acceptance 
Responsibility for patient care is transferred to the PACU nurse only after: 
Vital signs are stable and within acceptable limits. 
Airway is patent and breathing is adequate. 
Handover is complete and questions answered. 
Anesthesia provider documentation is complete. 
6. PACU MONITORING STANDARDS &amp; FREQUENCY (D2) 
6.1 Regulatory Basis 
The ASA Standards for Postanesthesia Care mandate that "A patient recovering from anesthesia shall be monitored and vital signs shall be recorded frequently as deemed appropriate by the anesthesiologist." Monitoring must be continuous and documented at intervals sufficient to detect deterioration early. 
6.2 Minimum Monitoring Elements (ASA-Aligned) 
A. Oxygenation Monitoring: 
Continuous Pulse Oximetry (SpO2): MANDATORY for all patients in Phase I recovery. 
Alarms: Audible alarms must be active (typically set low limit 90-92%). 
Clinical Assessment: Skin color and perfusion must be assessed regularly, recognizing limitations of pulse oximetry (lag time, motion artifact, poor perfusion). 
B. Ventilation Monitoring: 
Clinical Assessment: Respiratory rate, depth, pattern, and work of breathing must be assessed continuously. 
Capnography (ETCO2): Strongly recommended for high-risk patients (OSA, obesity, heavy opioid use) and mandatory for patients with artificial airways or deep sedation. It provides the earliest warning of airway obstruction or hypoventilation. 
Respiratory Rate Target: 10-20 breaths/min (adult). Bradypnea (&lt;8-10) or Tachypnea (&gt;25) requires immediate evaluation. 
C. Circulation Monitoring: 
Electrocardiogram (ECG): Continuous ECG monitoring is required for Phase I recovery to detect arrhythmias and ischemia. 
Blood Pressure (NIBP): 
Frequency: Measured immediately on arrival, then at least every 5 minutes for the first 15 minutes, and every 15 minutes thereafter if stable. 
Unstable Patients: Frequency increased to every 5 minutes or continuous invasive arterial monitoring as indicated. 
Heart Rate: Continuous monitoring via ECG and Pulse Oximetry. 
Perfusion Assessment: Capillary refill time, skin temperature, and urine output (if catheterized). 
D. Temperature Monitoring: 
Measurement: Core temperature (tympanic/oral) must be measured on admission and prior to discharge. 
Hypothermia Protocol: If admission temperature &lt;36.0°C, continuous warming measures are applied, and temperature is monitored every 15-30 minutes until normothermia is achieved. 
E. Neurological Monitoring: 
Level of Consciousness: Assessed on admission and with each set of vital signs using standardized scales (e.g., AVPU, RASS). 
Motor Function: Assessment of neuromuscular recovery (grip strength, head lift) and regression of regional blockade (Bromage score).

6.4 Continuous Observation Requirement 
PACU nursing staff must provide continuous visual observation of patients. Staffing ratios should be adjusted based on acuity: 
1:2 Ratio: Standard Phase I recovery (stable, unconscious/conscious). 
1:1 Ratio: Unstable airway, hemodynamic instability, age &lt; 8 years (until stable), or upon admission (first 15 min). 
2:1 Ratio: Critically ill, unstable, complex isolation. 
7. POST-ANESTHESIA RECOVERY SCORING SYSTEMS (D3) 
7.1 Purpose of Recovery Scoring 
Quantitative scoring systems provide an objective, evidence-based method to assess physiologic recovery and determine readiness for discharge. The Modified Aldrete Score is the standard for Phase I recovery. 
7.2 Modified Aldrete Score (PAR Score) 
The score evaluates 5 domains. A total score of ≥9 out of 10 is generally required for discharge (exceptions require physician documentation). 
DOMAIN

7.3 Scoring Interpretation &amp; Action 
Score 9-10: Ready for Phase I Discharge (if other criteria met). 
Score 7-8: Requires continued Phase I monitoring. Optimize oxygenation, analgesia, and fluids. 
Score &lt;7: Significant physiologic instability. Requires immediate evaluation by anesthesia provider and potential escalation of care. 
7.4 Documentation Requirements 
The Modified Aldrete Score must be documented: 
On PACU Admission (Baseline). 
Every 15-30 minutes during recovery. 
At the time of Discharge decision (Final Score). 
7.5 Alternative Scores 
PADSS (Post-Anesthetic Discharge Scoring System): Used for Phase II discharge (Ambulatory Surgery). 
Steward Score: Simplified score for pediatric patients (Consciousness, Airway, Movement). 
Bromage Score: Specifically for assessing motor block regression in regional anesthesia. 
8. PACU DISCHARGE CRITERIA (D4) 
8.1 General Discharge Principles 
Discharge from PACU Phase I to a ward, ICU, or Phase II unit occurs only when the patient meets defined physiologic safety criteria. The decision is a collaborative process led by the anesthesia provider and PACU nursing staff. 
8.2 Phase I Discharge Criteria (Standard Ward Transfer) 
Patients are eligible for discharge to a general inpatient ward when they meet the following evidence-based thresholds: 
Physiologic Stability (Aldrete Score ≥9): 
Return to baseline mental status (or appropriate for age/condition). 
Stable vital signs for at least 30 minutes. 
SpO2 &gt;92% on Room Air (or baseline oxygen requirement). 
Respiratory Safety: 
Patent airway with adequate protective reflexes (swallow/cough). 
No signs of respiratory distress, stridor, or significant work of breathing. 
Respiratory rate 10-20/min (adult). 
Hemodynamic Stability: 
No active bleeding. 
No requirement for vasoactive infusions (unless transferring to ICU/Step-down). 
Urine output adequate (&gt;0.5 mL/kg/hr) if catheterized. 
Symptom Control: 
Pain: Controlled to tolerable level (typically &lt;4/10) with oral/IV medication regimen established for ward. 
PONV: Nausea controlled; no active vomiting for at least 30 minutes. 
Temperature: Normothermic (&gt;36.0°C) without active shivering. 
Surgical Site: 
Dressings dry/intact; no expansion of hematoma. 
Drains functioning properly. 
Regional Anesthesia: 
Sensory level regressing; no signs of high spinal/epidural. 
Hemodynamic stability confirmed post-block. 
8.3 Discharge to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 
Patients who do NOT meet Phase I criteria due to critical illness or high monitoring needs must be transferred to an ICU. Criteria for direct ICU transfer include: 
Requirement for mechanical ventilation or advanced airway support. 
Hemodynamic instability requiring vasoactive infusions (pressors/inotropes). 
Invasive monitoring requirement (Arterial line, CVP, PICCO). 
Severe coagulopathy or active hemorrhage. 
Post-cardiac arrest or severe intraoperative complications. 
Failure to awaken (delayed emergence) requiring neurological monitoring. 
8.4 Discharge to Phase II (Ambulatory Surgery) 
For patients proceeding to discharge home, Phase II criteria apply (PADSS Score ≥9). Additional requirements include: 
Ability to ambulate (if appropriate). 
Ability to tolerate oral fluids (if required by protocol). 
Voiding (for specific procedures like spinal anesthesia, pelvic surgery). 
Responsible adult escort present. 
8.5 Physician Authorization 
Discharge must be authorized by an anesthesia provider. This may be: 
Direct Authorization: Physician assesses patient and writes discharge order. 
Protocol-Based Authorization: Nurse may discharge if strict criteria are met, documented, and standing orders allow (as per hospital policy). 
9. PAIN MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS (D5) 
9.1 Assessment Standards 
Pain management in the PACU is a priority. Assessment must be frequent, documented, and multidimensional. 
Frequency: On admission, every 15 minutes, and within 15-30 minutes after any analgesic intervention (Reassessment). 
Tools: 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS 0-10) for adults/older children. 
FLACC Scale for pediatric/non-verbal patients. 
Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) for intubated patients. 
Target: Pain Score &lt; 4/10 or patient-reported "tolerable" level. 
9.2 Multimodal Treatment Approach 
A multimodal approach reduces opioid consumption and side effects (OIVI, PONV). 
Step 1: Non-Opioid Foundation (Unless Contraindicated) 
Acetaminophen IV (1g) if not given intraop. 
NSAIDs (Ketorolac 15-30mg IV) for appropriate candidates (check renal function/bleeding risk). 
Regional Anesthesia: Verify block function; considering rescue block for severe pain. 
Step 2: Opioid Titration (Moderate-Severe Pain) 
Fentanyl: 25-50 mcg IV increments q5-10min. Rapid onset, short duration. 
Morphine: 2-4 mg IV increments q10-15min. Longer onset/duration. 
Hydromorphone: 0.2-0.5 mg IV increments q10-15min. Potent, use with caution. 
Step 3: Rescue / Adjuvants 
Ketamine: Low dose (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) for opioid-refractory pain. 
Lidocaine Infusion: Consider for visceral pain. 
Dexmedetomidine: For pain with agitation/anxiety. 
9.3 Opioid-Induced Ventilatory Impairment (OIVI) Monitoring 
Patients receiving IV opioids are at risk for OIVI. Monitoring is critical: 
Risk Factors: OSA, Obesity, Elderly, Opioid Naïve, Renal Failure, CNS depressants. 
Monitoring: Continuous SpO2 and Respiratory Rate. Capnography is recommended for high-risk patients receiving opioids. 
Sedation Assessment: Use Pasero Opioid-Induced Sedation Scale (POSS).
POSS 3 (Frequently drowsy/drifts off): Decrease opioid dose. 
POSS 4 (Somnolent/minimal response): STOP opioid, consider Naloxone, stimulate patient. 
9.4 Naloxone Protocol (Opioid Reversal) 
Indicated for severe respiratory depression (RR &lt;8, SpO2 &lt;90%, POSS 4). 
Dosing: Dilute 0.4mg ampoule in 9mL NS (total 10mL). Administer 0.04mg (1mL) increments IV every 2-3 minutes until respiratory rate improves. 
Goal: Restore adequate ventilation without reversing analgesia completely. 
Observation: Monitor for at least 60-90 minutes post-naloxone for "renarcotization" (opioid duration &gt; naloxone duration). 
10. PONV MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS (D6) 
10.1 Evidence-Based Guidelines (Fourth Consensus Guidelines 2020) 
Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) affects 30% of surgical patients and can delay discharge and increase morbidity. 
10.2 Assessment &amp; Risk Stratification 
Apfel Score (Adults): Female, Non-smoker, History of PONV/Motion Sickness, Postop Opioids. (0-4 risk factors = 10-80% risk). 
Assessment Frequency: On admission and with vital signs. Patient self-report ("Are you nauseous?"). 
10.3 Rescue Treatment Algorithm 
Treatment is guided by what prophylaxis was given intraoperatively. Do not repeat agents given within the last 6 hours (except short-acting). Use a different class of antiemetic. 
First-Line Rescue (If not given recently): 
Ondansetron (5HT3 Antagonist): 4mg IV (may repeat once). 
Second-Line Rescue (If Ondansetron fails or was given intraop): 
Dexamethasone (Steroid): 4-8mg IV (slow push). *Caution in labile diabetes/awake patients (perineal burning). 
Droperidol or Haloperidol (Butyrophenones): 0.625-1.25mg IV. *Monitor QT interval. 
Promethazine (Phenothiazine): 6.25-12.5mg IV. *Sedating, risk of extravasation injury. 
Third-Line / Adjuvants: 
Metoclopramide: 10mg IV. (Prokinetic, weak antiemetic). 
Scopolamine Patch: Apply early if not done. 
Isopropyl Alcohol Swabs: Aromatherapy (evidence supports temporary relief). 
Hydration: Ensure adequate IV fluid resuscitation (20mL/kg). 
11. RESPIRATORY EVENT ESCALATION (D7) 
11.1 Airway Emergencies in PACU 
Respiratory complications are the most common cause of PACU morbidity. Immediate recognition and intervention are critical. 
11.2 Management Algorithms 
A. Airway Obstruction / Stridor: 
Signs: Snoring, paradoxical chest movement, desaturation, stridor. 
Immediate Action: Jaw thrust/Chin lift, Oral/Nasal Airway insertion, 100% Oxygen. 
Treatment: Suction secretions. If stridor (laryngeal edema): Racemic Epinephrine nebulizer, Dexamethasone 4-8mg IV. 
Escalation: Call Anesthesia. Prepare for re-intubation if impending failure. 
B. Laryngospasm: 
Signs: High-pitched crowing or silence (complete spasm), rapid desaturation, bradycardia (late). 
Action: 
Remove Stimulus: Stop suctioning/movement. 
Positive Pressure: CPAP with 100% Oxygen (Tight mask seal + 20-30 cmH2O pressure). 
Larson's Maneuver: Jaw thrust + pressure on laryngospasm notch. 
Pharmacologic (If hypoxia persists): Propofol (sub-hypnotic dose 0.5mg/kg) or Succinylcholine (0.1-0.5 mg/kg IV). 
Re-intubation: If spasm unresolved. 
C. Hypoventilation / Apnea: 
Causes: Opioids, Residual Neuromuscular Blockade, Sedatives. 
Assessment: Check RR, ETCO2 (high), TOF ratio. 
Intervention: 
Stimulate Patient: Verbal/Tactile. 
Reverse Opioids: Naloxone (titrated). 
Reverse Benzodiazepines: Flumazenil (0.2mg IV). *Seizure risk. 
Reverse NMB: Neostigmine or Sugammadex (if TOF ratio &lt;0.9). 
D. Hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;90%): 
Algorithm: 
Increase FiO2 (Non-rebreather mask). 
Assess Airway/Breathing (Auscultate). 
Check for: Atelectasis, Pneumothorax, Pulmonary Edema, Pulmonary Embolism. 
Intervention: Upright positioning, Recruitment maneuvers, Diuretics (if fluid overload), Bronchodilators (if wheezing). 
Diagnostic: CXR, ABG. 
11.3 Re-Intubation Protocol 
Re-intubation is a high-risk event associated with increased mortality. It must be performed by an experienced anesthesia provider. 
Triggers: Inability to maintain airway, persistent hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;88% on high FiO2), severe respiratory acidosis (pH &lt;7.20), GCS &lt;8. 
Procedure: Call for help/code cart. Pre-oxygenate. Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) usually indicated. 
Disposition: All re-intubated patients must be transferred to ICU. 
12. HYPOTHERMIA &amp; SHIVERING MANAGEMENT (D8) 
12.1 Regulatory Basis (NICE CG65) 
Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia (Core Temp &lt;36.0°C) is associated with surgical site infections, coagulopathy, prolonged drug effects, and morbid cardiac events. Prevention and treatment are mandatory. 
12.2 Temperature Assessment 
Core temperature measurement on admission is mandatory. 
Preferred sites: Tympanic, Temporal (if validated), Bladder (if catheterized). 
Hypothermia Definition: Core temperature &lt; 36.0°C. 
12.3 Warming Protocol 
For Hypothermic Patients (&lt;36.0°C): 
Active Forced-Air Warming (Bair Hugger): First-line treatment. Apply immediately. 
Warmed IV Fluids: Use fluid warmers for any bolus fluids/blood products. 
Passive Warming: Warm cotton blankets (less effective alone but useful adjunct). 
Monitoring: Recheck temperature every 15-30 minutes. 
Goal: Minimum 36.0°C prior to discharge. 
12.4 Post-Anesthetic Shivering (PAS) 
Shivering increases oxygen consumption by 200-500% and aggravates pain. 
Causes: Hypothermia, Volatile anesthetics, Pain, Pyrogen release. 
Treatment: 
Warm Patient: Forced-air warming (skin surface warming treats shivering best). 
Pharmacologic: Meperidine (Pethidine) 12.5-25mg IV (Most effective agent; acts on kappa receptors). *Avoid in MAOI/SSRI users. 
Alternative: Clonidine 30-75mcg IV, Dexmedetomidine, or Magnesium Sulfate. 
13. TRANSFER &amp; HANDOVER TO WARD/ICU (D9) 
13.1 Discharge Decision 
Once discharge criteria (Section 8) are met, the anesthesia provider or authorized nurse initiates discharge. 
13.2 Structured Ward Handover 
A verbal report to the receiving ward nurse is mandatory (phone or in-person). It must follow the SBAR format and include: 
Situation: Patient Name, Procedure, Transferring from PACU. 
Background: Anesthesia type, Allergies, Comorbidities. 
Assessment: 
Vital signs range in PACU. 
Pain status (Last dose, Plan). 
PONV status. 
Surgical site/drains status. 
Fluid balance / Output. 
Recommendation: 
Specific monitoring orders (e.g., O2 therapy, Pulse Ox). 
IV fluid orders. 
Next antibiotic dose. 
Call criteria for physician. 
13.3 Transport to Ward 
Patient transported by porter and nurse (if indicated). 
Oxygen via cylinder if SpO2 labile. 
Handover of paperwork/records. 
14. SPECIAL POPULATIONS 
14.1 Pediatrics 
Emergence Delirium: Common (10-30%). Assess with PAED scale. Treat with reassurance, parent presence, Fentanyl/Propofol/Dexmedetomidine if severe. 
Airway: Higher risk of laryngospasm/croup. "No touch" emergence often used. 
Dosage: All medications weight-based. Double-check required. 
Family: Parent presence in PACU encouraged as soon as feasible. 
14.2 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) 
High Risk: Airway obstruction, opioid sensitivity. 
Monitoring: Continuous SpO2 + Capnography recommended. 
Positioning: Head elevated 30-45° or lateral. 
CPAP: Patient's home CPAP should be applied in PACU if desaturating or obstructing. 
14.3 Regional Anesthesia 
Motor/Sensory Check: Document regression of block. 
Safety: Protect insensate limbs. Fall precautions. 
Spinal: Confirm regression (e.g., &lt; T10) and hemodynamic stability before discharge. 
15. RESPONSIBILITIES 
Anesthesiologist / Anesthesia Provider: 
Safe transport and structured handover to PACU. 
Ordering PACU medications, fluids, and discharge criteria. 
Available for immediate consultation/intervention for complications. 
Authorizing discharge (or delegating via protocol).

1. PURPOSE 
To establish a standardized Procedural Sedation Program that ensures safe, consistent, and high-quality care for patients receiving minimal, moderate, or deep procedural sedation across all approved hospital locations through defined governance, privileging and competency requirements, pre-sedation assessment, monitoring standards, medication safety, recovery and discharge criteria, adverse event management and reporting, and pediatric-specific safeguards where applicable, consistent with CBAHI perioperative safety expectations for standardized processes, consent, checklists, medication reconciliation, and safe discharge after sedation. (istitlaa.ncc.gov.sa) 
2. SCOPE 
This policy applies to all procedural sedation delivered in the hospital by anesthesia professionals and by non-anesthesia practitioners who are credentialed and privileged to provide sedation under hospital rules, in all approved locations including (but not limited to): Emergency Department procedure rooms, Endoscopy, Interventional Radiology, Cardiac Catheterization, CT/MRI suites, bronchoscopy suites, outpatient procedure areas, minor procedure rooms, and any other approved sedation sites. 
This policy applies to: sedation providers (physicians/dentists/qualified practitioners), anesthesia professionals when involved, proceduralists, sedation monitors (nursing/clinical staff assigned to continuous monitoring), recovery nurses, pharmacists, and quality/patient safety personnel supporting the program. 
3. DEFINITIONS 
3.1 Levels of Sedation (Continuum) 
Minimal sedation (anxiolysis): Normal response to verbal stimulation; airway and ventilation unaffected; cardiovascular function unaffected. 
Moderate sedation: Purposeful response to verbal commands (with or without light tactile stimulation); airway intervention not required; spontaneous ventilation adequate; cardiovascular function usually maintained. 
Deep sedation: Purposeful response after repeated or painful stimulation; ability to maintain airway may be impaired; spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate; cardiovascular function usually maintained. 
General anesthesia: Unarousable even with painful stimulation; airway intervention often required; ventilation often inadequate; cardiovascular function may be impaired. 
(Definitions consistent with widely used sedation continuum concepts embedded in major sedation standards and hospital sedation procedures.) (aspho.org) 
3.2 Sedation Provider (Sedationist) 
A practitioner credentialed and privileged to administer procedural sedation within defined limits, and capable of recognizing progression to a deeper level and performing rescue interventions appropriate to the setting and intended sedation depth. (asahq.org) 
3.3 Sedation Monitor 
A trained staff member assigned to continuous patient monitoring during sedation and early recovery, with authority to stop the procedure and activate escalation when patient safety criteria are not met. 
3.4 Approved Sedation Location 
A location formally approved for procedural sedation through an institutional readiness process verifying minimum equipment, staffing, monitoring, medications (including reversal agents), and emergency response capability. (publicshare.albertahealthservices.ca) 
3.5 Rescue Capability 
Ability to identify deterioration and intervene to restore airway patency, support ventilation/oxygenation, and provide circulatory support, including activation of emergency response and transfer to higher level of care.

1. PURPOSE 
To ensure that regional and neuraxial anesthesia are delivered safely, consistently, and with standardized risk controls by defining service governance, privileging and competency (including ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia), correct-side verification, aseptic technique, monitoring requirements, documentation standards, anticoagulation safety processes, continuous catheter management, and prevention/management of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). This policy supports the CBAHI expectation that perioperative and procedural care follows standardized processes and meets national and cited international standards. (istitlaa.ncc.gov.sa) 
2. SCOPE 
This policy applies to all regional and neuraxial anesthesia performed in the Operating Rooms (OR), block areas, PACU, and approved remote procedural areas, including: 
Neuraxial techniques: spinal, epidural, combined spinal–epidural (CSE), and neuraxial opioid/adjunct administration associated with these techniques. 
Peripheral nerve blocks (PNB): upper limb, lower limb, truncal, and other single-shot ultrasound-guided or landmark/nerve stimulator techniques. 
Continuous catheter techniques: epidural catheters and peripheral nerve catheters for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. 
Regional anesthesia performed as primary anesthetic or as analgesic adjunct, with or without sedation. 
This policy applies to all clinicians and staff involved in regional/neuraxial anesthesia: anesthesiologists/anesthesia professionals, anesthesia technicians, PACU nurses involved in monitoring regional effects, acute pain service (if present), and any assisting staff. 
3. DEFINITIONS 
Regional anesthesia: Anesthetic/analgesic techniques that block nerve conduction in targeted neural structures (neuraxial or peripheral) using local anesthetics with or without adjuvants. 
Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (UGRA): Use of ultrasound imaging to identify anatomy and guide needle placement and/or local anesthetic injection. 
Stop-Before-You-Block / Prep-Stop-Block: A standardized pause immediately before needle insertion or injection to verify correct side/site, correct patient, correct block, and readiness, designed to prevent wrong-side blocks. (The Royal College of Anaesthetists) 
Neuraxial hematoma: Bleeding within the spinal canal potentially causing neurological compromise; risk increased with anticoagulants/antiplatelets and traumatic needle placement. 
LAST (Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity): Systemic toxicity from local anesthetic exposure, potentially causing neurologic and cardiovascular collapse; requires immediate recognition and lipid emulsion therapy as per guideline checklists. (ASRA Pain Medicine) 
Continuous catheter: Perineural or epidural catheter used to deliver local anesthetic infusion/bolus for ongoing analgesia.

POLICY: Standard Monitoring Alarms and Default Limits (OR + NORA + PACU) 
1. PURPOSE 
To reduce preventable harm from missed physiologic deterioration by ensuring monitoring alarms are enabled, standardized default limits are applied, and alarm modifications are managed safely and documented. 
2. SCOPE 
Applies to all physiologic monitoring used during anesthesia and recovery in OR, NORA, and PACU (and PACU-equivalent areas), including ECG, pulse oximetry, NIBP/IBP, capnography, oxygen concentration monitoring (where present), ventilator alarms, and temperature monitoring. (ASA) 
3. DEFINITIONS 
Default limits: Department-standard starting alarm thresholds for typical adult patients, adjusted as clinically appropriate. 
Alarm pause/silence: Temporary silencing of audible alarms; does not disable alarm detection. 
Alarm disable: Turning off alarm detection; generally prohibited except under defined circumstances. 
4. POLICY 
4.1 Alarms shall be enabled and audible/visible for all monitored parameters appropriate to the anesthetic/sedation phase, consistent with minimum monitoring standards. (PMC) 
4.2 Default alarm limits shall be applied at case start and may be individualized to patient condition, procedure, and baseline physiology; individualized limits must remain protective and not mask clinically important deterioration. 
4.3 Permanent disabling of alarms is prohibited except for documented technical reasons with an alternative safety strategy implemented immediately. 
4.4 Alarm limits and key alarm changes during anesthesia and PACU recovery shall be documented when they materially affect safety (e.g., deliberate permissive hypotension strategy). 
5. PROCEDURES 
5.1 General Rules 
A. Confirm alarm function at setup (audibility, visibility, remote display where relevant). 
B. Set default limits at the start of monitoring and confirm NIBP cycling interval is appropriate (commonly every 3–5 minutes during general anesthesia unless otherwise indicated). (ASA) 
C. If alarms are silenced for procedures requiring quiet conditions, visual monitoring must be continuous and audible alarms restored as soon as feasible. 
5.2 Standard Default Alarm Limits (Adult—Starting Point) 
Default limits must be adapted for pediatrics and for special populations. As a starting point, use: 
SpO₂ low: 94% (or locally approved threshold) 
HR low/high: 50 / 120 bpm 
NIBP: systolic low/high 90 / 160 mmHg (or MAP low 65) 
ETCO₂ low/high: 30 / 50 mmHg (when capnography in use) 
Ventilator pressure high: locally set per patient and mode 
Apnea/disconnect alarm: enabled whenever ventilatory support is provided 
These are defaults only; patient-specific targets may be different (e.g., chronic hypercapnia, deliberate hypotension), but safety limits must remain meaningful. 
5.3 Special Settings 
A. NORA limited-access environments (e.g., MRI): alarms must be visible/audible from the control area; remote displays are required where patient access is constrained. (ASA) 
B. PACU: alarm limits should be adjusted to recovery phase and oxygen plan; high-risk patients (OSA, opioid titration) require tighter vigilance. 
5.4 Alarm Modification Process 
A. When modifying alarm limits for clinical reasons, confirm:
rationale (baseline physiology/clinical strategy), 
alternative protective monitoring (e.g., arterial line), 
staff awareness (PACU/handovers). 
B. Restore default limits when the indication ends. 
5.5 Technical Failure 
A. If an alarm system fails, stop and correct before proceeding when feasible; if urgent continuation is required, implement equivalent alternative monitoring and escalate to biomedical engineering. 
6. RESPONSIBILITIES 
Anesthesia professional/PACU nurse: sets and maintains safe alarm limits, responds to alarms promptly. 
Biomedical engineering: resolves recurring alarm malfunctions and maintains equipment. 
7. DOCUMENTATION / RECORDS 
Monitor setup verification and alarm changes (when clinically significant). 
Equipment fault reports. 
8. COMPLIANCE / AUDIT 
Periodic audit of alarm enablement and NIBP interval settings in random cases; event review for alarm-related misses.

To establish a structured Anesthesia &amp; Procedural Sedation Quality Program that defines (1) what is measured (KPIs), (2) how performance is monitored (audits/registries), (3) how results are reported and reviewed, and (4) how improvement actions are planned, implemented, and sustained, including compliance monitoring for anesthesia/sedation documentation, PACU discharge processes, sedation adverse event reporting, and equipment safety checks. 
2. SCOPE 
This policy applies to anesthesia and sedation services delivered in: 
OR (Operating Rooms) 
PACU (Phase I and PACU-equivalent recovery areas) 
NORA (Non-Operating Room Anesthesia and anesthesia-supported procedural sedation locations) 
It applies to all anesthesia professionals, privileged sedation providers, PACU staff, anesthesia technologists, quality/safety staff, data analysts, and departmental leadership. 
3. DEFINITIONS 
KPI (Key Performance Indicator): A defined measure used to monitor quality, safety, compliance, or outcomes over time (with numerator/denominator, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and reporting cadence). 
Audit: A structured review of compliance against an agreed standard, using sampling methodology and a defined scoring tool. 
Registry: A structured dataset for capturing events or outcomes (e.g., sedation adverse event registry) for trending and improvement. 
Close call / Near miss: An event that could have caused harm but did not, either by interception or luck (captured for learning). 
PDSA Cycle: Plan–Do–Study–Act improvement method used to implement and test changes. 
PACU discharge criteria: Defined evidence-based criteria for safe PACU discharge; continuous monitoring is required until the patient is stable and safely discharged meeting defined criteria. (استطلاع) 
ASA documentation expectations: Documentation should be accurate and thorough across the three phases of anesthesia-related care. (ASA) 
4. POLICY 
4.1 The anesthesia department shall maintain a formal Quality, Audit, and Continuous Improvement program covering anesthesia, sedation, PACU recovery processes, and equipment readiness. 
4.2 The department shall define a balanced KPI set (process, outcome, and balancing measures) with clear definitions, targets, data sources, and review cadence. 
4.3 The department shall conduct recurring audits for:
anesthesia and sedation record completion, aligned with documentation expectations, (ASA) 
PACU discharge compliance (monitoring, scoring use, exception documentation), aligned with continuous monitoring and discharge criteria expectations, (استطلاع) 
equipment safety check compliance (anesthesia machine check, airway cart readiness, crisis carts/kits checks). 
4.4 The department shall maintain a Procedural Sedation Adverse Event Registry and ensure adverse events and close calls are considered for reporting through the organization’s safety reporting system, consistent with recognized sedation program procedures. (publicshare.albertahealthservices.ca) 
4.5 The department shall perform an annual anesthesia and sedation risk assessment and develop a written improvement plan with assigned owners, timelines, and follow-up monitoring. 
4.6 KPI results, audit findings, and registry trends shall be reviewed in a structured governance forum and translated into corrective actions, staff feedback, and re-audit to confirm improvement.

3. Patient Declaration and Understanding 
I, the undersigned, acknowledge and understand that: 
The purpose and nature of anesthesia have been explained to me. I understand that
anesthesia involves the use of drugs/techniques to prevent pain and awareness during surgery.
Anesthesia is an independent medical service separate from the surgical procedure,
provided by an anesthesia care team.
The choice of anesthesia technique is determined by the anesthesiologist based on
my medical condition and the surgical requirements.
While standard procedures are followed, the anesthesia plan may need to be modified
(e.g., converting from sedation to general anesthesia) if medical necessity arises during the procedure.
Vital signs and body functions will be monitored continuously during the procedure.
Medical students or residents may participate in my anesthesia care under the
direct supervision of the attending anesthesiologist (if applicable at this facility).
I have had the opportunity to ask questions, and they have been answered to my
satisfaction.
4. Risks and Possible Complications 
I understand that while anesthesia is generally safe, it carries risks ranging from minor side effects to
life-threatening complications.
Common Side Effects (Temporary): 
Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) 
Sore throat / Hoarseness 
Dizziness / Drowsiness / Confusion 
Shivering / Muscle aches 
Pain/Bruising at injection sites 
Specific Risks (Less Common): 
Dental injury (chips, loose teeth) or lip trauma 
Urinary retention (inability to pass urine) 
Corneal abrasion (eye scratch) 
Awareness (recalling events during surgery) 
Serious / Rare Complications: I understand rare but serious risks exist, including but not
limited to:
Severe Allergic Reaction (Anaphylaxis) 
Aspiration Pneumonia (stomach contents in lungs) 
Nerve injury / Paralysis 
Malignant Hyperthermia (rare genetic reaction) 
Stroke / Brain Injury 
Heart Attack / Cardiac Arrest 
Severe breathing difficulties / Prolonged ventilation
Death 
5. Additional Risks for Regional / Neuraxial Anesthesia (If Applicable) 
Failed block / Inadequate pain relief (requiring GA)
Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH) 
Backache (temporary) 
Epidural Hematoma (bleeding) / Abscess (infection) 
Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) 
High Spinal (breathing/heart difficulty) 
6. Blood Product Transfusion 
In the event of significant bleeding, blood transfusion may be lifesaving. 
I CONSENT to the administration of blood or blood products if
deemed medically necessary by the anesthesia/surgical team. Risks (infection, reaction, overload) have been
explained.
I REFUSE blood products (e.g., Jehovah's Witness). I understand
this refusal increases the risk of serious morbidity or death.
7. Consent for Anesthesia 
I certify that I have read (or had read to me) the contents of this form. The anesthesia plan, its benefits,
significant risks, and alternative options (including no anesthesia) have been explained to me. I have had the
opportunity to ask questions, and all my questions have been answered satisfactorily. I voluntarily consent to the
administration of anesthesia.
